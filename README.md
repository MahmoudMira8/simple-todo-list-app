# simple-todo-list-app
This is a simple Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add and delete tasks from their list.

## Features
* Add tasks to the list
* Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox
* Delete tasks from the list
* Automatically saves tasks to the browser's local storage, so the list persists even after closing the browser
## Installation
  To use this application, simply download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and open the HTML file in a web browser.

## Usage
To add a task, type the task into the text input and click the "Add" button. The task will be added to the bottom of the list. To mark a task as completed, check the checkbox next to the task. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

## Local Storage
This application uses the browser's local storage to store the list of tasks. This means that the list will be saved even if you close the browser or navigate away from the page. To clear the list, simply delete the "todos" key from local storage using your browser's developer tools.
